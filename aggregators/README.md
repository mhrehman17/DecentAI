<!-- Planned Aggregation Algorithms -->
## :compass: Roadmap

* [x] Vanilla Mean.
* [x] Vanilla Median
* [ ] Federated Averaging (FedAvg): The foundational algorithm that averages model parameters from clients.
* [ ] Federated Proximal (FedProx): Introduces a regularization term to penalize divergence among client models.
* [ ] Federated Model Aggregation (FedMA): Aggregates models layer-wise, matching and merging similar nodes.
* [ ] FedDist: Modifies model architecture based on client-specific dissimilarities among neurons.
* [ ] FedPer: Incorporates a base and personalized layer with transfer learning methodologies.
* [ ] Clustered Federated Learning: Groups clients into clusters for localized aggregation.
* [ ] Robust Aggregation Techniques: Focuses on resilience against outliers and adversarial attacks.
* [ ] Asynchronous Aggregation: Allows clients to send updates at different times.
* [ ] Privacy-Preserving Aggregation: Uses cryptographic methods to secure model parameters.
* [ ] Adaptive Aggregation: Adjusts aggregation strategies based on real-time feedback.
