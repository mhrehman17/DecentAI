# DecentAI (An Agentic Decentralized AI Platform)

## Objective:

To develop a scalable framework-agnostic decentralized AI platform for research community.

## Key Features

### ðŸ¤” Framework-agnostic
Bring any kind of ML/DL/AI framwork from Pytorch and TensorFlow to Keras and Vanilla ML libraries.

### ðŸ¤” Agentic
Every Compute, Storage, and Communication Activitty is performed by intelligent agents

### ðŸ¤” Decentralized
No single point of failure in the entire system. All agents can communicate without centralized control. 

### ðŸ¤” Scalable
The platform support every kind of data source and every kind of compute device/system

### ðŸ¤” Secure
The system is designed with security-first approach

### ðŸ¤” Privacy-preserving
The privacy of each data producer and data subject is preserved across the system

### ðŸ¤” Device-Native
The control and preference lies at the device-end

### ðŸ¤” Distributed
The platform complies with all functional and non-functional requirements of a distributed system

### ðŸ¤” Collaborative
Agents can collaborate beyond the system boundaries

### ðŸ¤” Democratic
Every AI asset owner (i.e. data producers, data processors, model developers, model owners, compute providers, etc.) have complete control and ownership
